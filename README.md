# Art Wrap

# Summary:

In Art Wrap, you are an art handler in a chaotic gallery who must pack artworks last-minute so they can be shipped out just in time for the next big show.

# Functionality & MVPs:

In this game, users will be able to:
- start and restart game
- use keyboard to select packaging materials to wrap each artwork
- move up to new levels
- see a timer countdown

## Bonus
- after several levels, move on to new tier with new obstacles
- implementing a counter that shows number of levels (or artworks) completed

This project will also include:
- a production README

# Wireframe:
![wireframe](./wireframe/wireframe.png)

- Keys will include the three types of artwork (painting, framed drawing, sculpture), and the order of packaging materials that goes with each artwork type.
- Each packaging material corresponds to the four arrow keys. They must be selected in the order listed in the keys.

# Technologies, Libraries:
-This project uses canvas API, HTML, CSS, Javascript, maybe 3js, webGL (I might also use third party sites to create my own sprites)

# Implementation Timeline:
- Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Set up webpack environment and display canvas on browser, work on game logic and pinning down the list of classes needed (currently: Game, Artwork, Material). Research and test out canvas and/or j3s framework code snippets. Set up basic functionality of game on screen.
- Monday: Continue with game logic coding, testing user control
- Tuesday: Continue with user control testing and moving games to second level. Start to work on views and styling 
- Wednesday: keep working on views, bug-fixing, and polishing text copy for README and anything else as necessary.
- Thursday Morning: Deploy project to github
